# Research Background

## Overview

The AI Biology Playground is built upon groundbreaking research in AI interpretability and mechanistic understanding of large language models. This document provides context for the research concepts and methodologies demonstrated in the application.

## Core Research Concepts

### Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs)

Sparse Autoencoders represent a breakthrough in AI interpretability, allowing researchers to extract individual "features" or concepts from neural network activations.

**Key Concepts:**
- **Monosemantic Features**: Individual neurons or feature directions that correspond to interpretable concepts
- **Sparsity**: Most features are inactive for any given input, making them easier to interpret
- **Reconstruction**: SAEs learn to reconstruct model activations using sparse feature combinations

**Mathematical Foundation:**
```
SAE(x) = W_dec · ReLU(W_enc · x + b_enc) + b_dec
Loss = ||x - SAE(x)||² + λ||ReLU(W_enc · x + b_enc)||₁
```

Where:
- `x`: Input activations from a language model layer
- `W_enc`, `W_dec`: Encoder and decoder weight matrices
- `λ`: Sparsity penalty coefficient
- `||·||₁`: L1 norm encouraging sparsity

### Attribution Graphs

Attribution graphs reveal how features influence each other and contribute to model outputs, creating "computational pathways" through the neural network.

**Components:**
- **Nodes**: Individual features or model components
- **Edges**: Causal relationships and information flow
- **Weights**: Strength of attribution or influence
- **Pathways**: Multi-step reasoning chains

**Computation Methods:**
- **Integrated Gradients**: Compute feature importance by integrating gradients along paths
- **Activation Patching**: Artificially modify activations to measure causal effects
- **Attention Flow**: Track how attention patterns create information pathways

### Circuit Analysis

Circuit analysis identifies recurring computational patterns and "algorithms" that neural networks use to solve specific tasks.

**Types of Circuits:**
- **Induction Heads**: Copy and complete patterns
- **Indirect Object Identification**: Track relationships between entities
- **Arithmetic Circuits**: Perform mathematical operations
- **Safety Circuits**: Detect and respond to harmful content
